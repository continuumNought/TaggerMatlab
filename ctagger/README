The ctagger package provides interfaces for user to tag events using a
user-expandable hierarcharical tagging ontology. The HED Specification
hierarchy, developed by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo of UCSD is provided with the
distribution for users wishing to tag events in EEG experiments. (See the
user's manual for 

MATLAB:
       To test in MATLAB run the testScript.m file after adding ctagger
       and its subdirectories to the path.  

Unit tests:   
       Add the ctagger directory and its subdirectories to the MATLAB path.  
       In the tests directory, type runtests.


Trying it out:
       The testScript.m contains tests

GUI operation:

To tag:    
     You can drag and drop tags from right side to left side

     Alternatively you can highlight an event in the left side --- and click events on right side to add

     To edit anything --- click the push pin next to it and a menu appears on the bottom

     You can type the start of the tag and the pull down will give partial matches

Other:
      Change font size by hovering over top menu and clicking +/-

Right now deletion is allowed on everything......this can be turned off and 
on but configuration of this has been turned off.


If you want to call the GUI separately from MATLAB --- say from the command line

java -jar  ctagger.jar "F:\temp\HED Specification 1.2.xml"

You have to give the full pathname to HED and need the quotes because of the blanks.
